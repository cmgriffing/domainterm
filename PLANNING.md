- implement caching
- watch a file containing base words for changes and update the queues
- reorganize code to use daemons (long running intervals that pop items off their respective queues)
- save results to files
- implement TUI using `blessed` or `ink`
- add queue for doing search lookup
  - still unsure of how to do the search. Maybe an API or maybe even just scraping the google results page via playwright?
- perform social lookups
- add queue for asking LLM to evaluate available domains
- add a trademark lookup
